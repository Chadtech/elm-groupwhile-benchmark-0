Just bench marking the new and old versions of `groupWhile` for `elm-community/list-extra` for [this pr](https://github.com/elm-community/list-extra/pull/119). I would have used [ellie](https://www.ellie-app.com), but it hasnt been working for me lately.

[Heres the live link](http://elm-groupwhile-benchmark-0.surge.sh/)

Results:
new groupWhile is about 15% slower, but stack safe.
